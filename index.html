                This is a visulaisation to show some visualizations about the USA's Economy since 2011 until 2021.
                I will show some stats, for ex. GDP per state, which is a measure for the size of an economy per state. 
                I will also show the average Income of person in each state of the USA. </h3>

            <h3 >The United States Economy is always considered one of the strongest 
                economies in the world. But we all know that the United States is made of 50 states,
                which is alot. Not all the states are equally rich or poor, so that's what I will try to show in this'visualization.
                In this visualization, I'm trying to show the strong and the weak states by many econmical factors.         </h3>

            This bar chart shows the average income of person in each state. It is obvious that california is 
            the highest state in this chart, it once again prove that this state is econmically strong.
            The difference is big between california and the rest, but most states are doing good.
            Texas is also the second state with average income per person, and New York is the third.
            We can see that the GDP numberws matches with the average income per person in each state.
